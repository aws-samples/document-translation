# Recommendation

This is the recommended installation method, using AWS CloudShell with Codecommit. CloudShell provides you with many of the tools required and provides permissions to complete the installation. This installation guide has been tested with CloudShell. If not using CloudShell you are expected to understand how to install and configure dependencies and change any actions to your particular system.
